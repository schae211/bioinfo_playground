Coming from biochemistry and diving into bioinformatics, I find it takes quite a long time to understand methods that are used in the single-cell biology field. To better understand methods, I try to build them from scratch or play around with them, the results of which I collect here.

In bioinformatics (or data science?) there is a trade-off between using functions from established packages that have been used/tested by many many people and implementing these functions on your own to understand things better.

This being said, I cannot guarantee that the things I write are correct. I am always happy if others point out that I understood something incorrectly.

In terms of topics, I have worked with single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq, and various spatial omics data so far. Therefore, I will focus here on methods that are applicable to these domains.
